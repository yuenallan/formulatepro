# Do you offer FormulatePro for Mac OS X 10.3 (Panther) or lower? #

Sorry, but FormulatePro is Tiger, Leopard, and Snow Leopard only. FormulatePro uses Apple technology (specifically PDFKit) which was first released as a component in Tiger, hence the requirement.

# Is this page a good place to post my questions? #

**No!**

Do one of the following instead:
  * Post to the [discussion group](http://groups.google.com/group/formulatepro)
  * Within the program, choose Menu Bar->FormulatePro->Provide FormulatePro Feedback by Email

If you do one of these, you should generally get a reply within 24 hours.
